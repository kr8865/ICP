1. Introduction to 1D Arrays
Definition & representation in memory
Indexing (0-based)
Static vs dynamic arrays

2. Iteration Techniques 
Forward iteration (0 → n-1)
Reverse iteration (n-1 → 0)
Step iteration (skipping elements)
Enhanced for-loop (for-each)
Dry-run on examples

3. Operations on Elements 
Accessing elements
Updating values
Summation (total, prefix sums, row/col-wise analogy)
Searching (linear & binary search)
Transformations (map, scale)
Swapping, reversing

4. Patterns and Conceptual Tricks
Prefix sum technique
Sliding window
Two-pointer method
Kadane’s algorithm (max subarray sum)
Frequency arrays (counting)

5. Advanced Traversal Examples 
Rotating arrays (left/right shifts)
Merging two sorted arrays
Partitioning arrays (even–odd, negatives–positives)
Next greater element concept

6. Problem-Solving Session 
Live coding walkthroughs
Step-by-step dry runs
Common pitfalls and optimization tips
